Generates string permutations of the specified length in a stable order. Use basic terminal stuff (`>`) if you want to dump to a file for reasons.


In your terminal

```zsh
user@machine.local string_gen % python3 string_generator.py
Enter password length: 8
aaaaaaaa
aaaaaaab
aaaaaaac
aaaaaaad
aaaaaaae
aaaaaaaf
aaaaaaag
aaaaaaah
aaaaaaai
```
