The program uses the C++11 `<random>` library to generate random numbers. It first creates a `std::random_device` object to seed the random number generator, and then creates a `std::mt19937` object as the generator itself. It uses a `std::uniform_int_distribution` object to generate random integers in the range `[0, 255]`, which are then cast to `unsigned char` values and stored in an array of 16 bytes.

The program then sets the version and variant fields of the GUID by manipulating certain bytes in the array. Finally, it converts the byte array to a hex string using a loop and the `hex_chars` lookup table, and returns the resulting GUID as a `std::string`.

Note that the `generate_guid` function returns a `std::string` rather than a `char*` to avoid memory management issues. The program also includes a main function that calls `generate_guid` and prints the resulting GUID to the console.

This implementation isn't good enough for security purposes.
