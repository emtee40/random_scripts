Outputs basic network information in the format:

```
# Print information
echo "Network Interface: $interface"
echo "MAC Addresses: $mac_addresses"
echo "IP Addresses: $ip_addresses"
echo "Gateway IP: $gateway_ip"
```

To run the shell script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where the shell script is saved using the `cd` command. For example, if the script is saved in the `/home/user/scripts/` directory, you can navigate to that directory using `cd /home/user/scripts/`.
3. Make the shell script executable by running the command `chmod +x script_name.sh`, replacing `script_name.sh` with the name of the actual script file.
4. Run the shell script by typing `./script_name.sh` and pressing Enter, replacing `script_name.sh` with the name of the actual script file.

For example, if the script is saved as `network_info.sh` in the `/home/user/scripts/` directory, you would navigate to that directory using `cd /home/user/scripts/`, make the script executable with `chmod +x network_info.sh`, and then run the script with `./network_info.sh`.
