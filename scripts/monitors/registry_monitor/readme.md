In this script, you can specify the Windows Registry path and value you want to monitor by modifying the `$registryPath` and `$registryValue` variables. The script then enters an infinite loop where it checks the current value of the registry key every minute. If the value has changed since the last check, the script writes a message to the console and performs any necessary notifications (which you can add yourself).

To run this script, save it as a .ps1 file and run it using PowerShell:

```
.\registry_monitor.ps1
``` 

Make sure to run PowerShell as an administrator if you're monitoring a registry key that requires elevated privileges to access.
